BIANCA: They do not!
CAMERON: They do to!
BIANCA: I hope so.
CAMERON: She okay?
BIANCA: Let's go.
CAMERON: Wow
BIANCA: Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how to lie.
CAMERON: No
BIANCA: I'm kidding.  You know how sometimes you just become this "persona"?  And you don't know how to quit?
BIANCA: Like my fear of wearing pastels?
CAMERON: The "real you".
BIANCA: What good stuff?
CAMERON: I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.
CAMERON: Thank God!  If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...
BIANCA: Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
CAMERON: What crap?
BIANCA: do you listen to this crap?
CAMERON: No...
BIANCA: Then Guillermo says, "If you go any lighter, you're gonna look like an extra on 90210."
CAMERON: You always been this selfish?
BIANCA: But
CAMERON: Then that's all you had to say.
BIANCA: Well, no...
CAMERON: You never wanted to go out with 'me, did you?
BIANCA: I was?
CAMERON: I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be "occupied".
BIANCA: Tons
CAMERON: Have fun tonight?
CAMERON: I believe we share an art instructor
BIANCA: You know Chastity?
CAMERON: Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?
BIANCA: Hi.
BIANCA: Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
CAMERON: So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
BIANCA: Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
CAMERON: She's not a...
CAMERON: I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him.
BIANCA: I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
CAMERON: Sure have.
BIANCA: Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days. And I never, ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment.
CAMERON: How do you get your hair to look like that?
BIANCA: You're sweet.
CAMERON: You have my word.  As a gentleman
BIANCA: I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date?
CAMERON: You got something on your mind?
BIANCA: Where?
CAMERON: There.
CAMERON: Well, there's someone I think might be --
BIANCA: How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?
BIANCA: Forget French.
CAMERON: That's because it's such a nice one.
BIANCA: I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
CAMERON: Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
BIANCA: C'esc ma tete. This is my head
CAMERON: Let me see what I can do.
BIANCA: Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...
CAMERON: That's a shame.
BIANCA: Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
CAMERON: Why?
CAMERON: Seems like she could get a date easy enough...
BIANCA: The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.
CAMERON: Cameron.
BIANCA: No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---
CAMERON: Forget it.
BIANCA: You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?
CAMERON: Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
BIANCA: Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
CAMERON: Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
BIANCA: Can we make this quick?  Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad.  Again.
BIANCA: I did.
CHASTITY: You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?
CHASTITY: I don't have to be home 'til two.
BIANCA: I have to be home in twenty minutes.
CHASTITY: All I know is -- I'd give up my private line to go out with a guy like Joey.
BIANCA: Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
CHASTITY: Bianca, I don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding.
BIANCA: Combination.  I don't know -- I thought he'd be different.  More of a gentleman...
CHASTITY: Is he oily or dry?
BIANCA: He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation.
BIANCA: Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?
CHASTITY: Great
BIANCA: Joey.
CHASTITY: Who?
BIANCA: Where did he go?  He was just here.
BIANCA: You might wanna think about it
CHASTITY: No.
BIANCA: Did you change your hair?
BIANCA: You know the deal.  I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go --
JOEY: Listen, I want to talk to you about the prom.
JOEY: You're concentrating awfully hard considering it's gym class.
BIANCA: Hi, Joey.
JOEY: Hey, sweet cheeks.
JOEY: My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.
BIANCA: Neat...
JOEY: It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be, like, wearing a uniform and stuff.
BIANCA: Queen Harry?
JOEY: So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig " that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week.
BIANCA: Hopefully.
JOEY: Exactly  So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?
BIANCA: Expensive?
